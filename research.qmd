## Particle Physics
### Belle II

I am currently a member of the Belle II collaboration. My research focuses on developing low-latency machine learning algorithms to be deployed on FPGAs for the Belle II Level-1 trigger.

### Electron-Ion Collider

Before joining Belle II, I worked worked with the ePIC collaboration on the development and implementation of advanced machine learning algorithms for energy and angle reconstruction in the far-forward calorimetry at the Electron-Ion Collider. I also assisted in the validation of a new DD4hep-based simulation framework. 

## Condensed Matter Physics
### Quantum Phase Transitions

I am working with Noah Charles on a novel method of introducing geometric disorder to the Chalker-Coddington network model in order to accurately compute the critical exponent for the integer quantum hall transition.
