    "text": "I am a graduate student at The University of Tokyo and a member of the Belle II group at the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe. I am also a member of the Center for Data-Driven Discovery. My thesis advisor is  Takeo Higuchi and my secondary supervisor is  Thomas Melia.\nPreviously, I was a research assistant at Reed College, where I worked with Noah Charles on disordered network models for the integer quantum hall transition. Before that, I was a SULI intern in the Data Science and Machine Intelligence group at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, where my mentor was Jan Strube.\nI earned my B.A. in Physics from Reed College in May 2022. My thesis advisor was Joel Franklin."

My research focuses on developing fast machine learning algorithms on FPGAs to improve the efficiency of the Belle II L1 trigger.\n\n\n\n\nBefore joining Belle II, I worked on the development and implementation of advanced machine learning algorithms for energy and angle reconstruction in the Zero-Degree Calorimeter for the future Electron-Ion Collider. Data from simulations was used to perform the first angle reconstruction for hadronic showers in the far-forward calorimetry using a graph neural network. I also worked with the ePIC collaboration on refinement and validation of a new DD4hep-based framework for simulation studies."
