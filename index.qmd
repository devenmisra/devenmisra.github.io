I am currently a graduate student in the <a href="https://member.ipmu.jp/takeo.higuchi/belle2/" style="text-decoration: none">Belle II group</a> at the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (IPMU). My advisor is Professor <a href="https://db.ipmu.jp/member/personal/2440en.html" style="text-decoration: none"> Takeo Higuchi</a>. 

Previously, I was a research assistant at Reed College, where I worked with Professor <a href="https://www.reed.edu/physics/faculty/" style="text-decoration: none">Noah Charles</a> on disordered network models for the integer quantum hall transition. Before that, I was a SULI intern in the Data Science and Machine Intelligence group at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, where my mentor was Dr. <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/people/jan-strube" style="text-decoration: none">Jan Strube</a>. 

I earned my B.A. in Physics from Reed College in May 2022. My thesis advisor was Professor <a href="https://people.reed.edu/~jfrankli/" style="text-decoration: none">Joel Franklin</a>.
